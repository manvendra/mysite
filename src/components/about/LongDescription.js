                For two decades, I've lived though a lot ot Softwares development history,
                without any significant contribution in shaping it. <br />
                However, I did work on different solutions, for various clients,
                in different countries, on various architecture using plethora of technologies.
                <br /><br />
                I've seen the downfall of corba by the rise of then hottest but heaviest thing in town called EJB.
                It was later turned into the biggest villain and defeated by lean pojos.

                I've lived the struggle of de-compiling jars to get to codebase,
                which was eased with the use of VSS & CVS,
                furthermore by SVN & clearQuest and finally took a breather at Git.

                I'm guilty of production deployments from local deployable,
                which was streamlined by deployable created on dedicated-build-servers.
                later standardized by hudson which was converted into Jenkins
                and now highly automated by various pipeline solutions.

                I've seen when designing a page was not easy because CSS use to have only 50 properties. Yes just 50.
